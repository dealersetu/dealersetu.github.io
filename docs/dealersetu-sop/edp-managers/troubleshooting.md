Common issues and solutions for DealerSetu.

## Common Issues faced by EDPs

### Issue 1: Vehicle Not Showing in Listing (OTF Present, Customer Name Missing)

#### Problem
The **Sales Manager (SM)** reports that a vehicle is **not visible in the listing**, even though the **OTF number is present**. The **customer name is not displayed**, and in some cases the **FSC/SM name is also not visible**.


#### Solution

1. **OTF Present but Customer Name Not Visible**
   - The **Booking Coordinator** must **map the OTF number with the customer**.
   - Until this mapping is done, the customer name will not appear in the listing.

2. **FSC/SM Name Not Visible**
   - The **Receptionist** must **map the customer with the Sales Consultant (FSC/SM)**.
   - If the customer is not mapped correctly, the FSC/SM name will not be shown.

3. **For Free Stock Vehicles**
   - If the **SM name is visible inside the Edit screen** of the chassis number in EDP:
     - The vehicle is **on hold under the same SM**.
   - If **no OTF number is present but the SM name is visible**:
     - The vehicle is already **under that SM’s booking** and is not truly free stock.
