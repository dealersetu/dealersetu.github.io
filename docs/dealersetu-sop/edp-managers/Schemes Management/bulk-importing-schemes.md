# Bulk Importing Schemes

This guide explains how an **EDP (Electronic Data Processor)** can bulk import schemes into the DealerSetu system.

## Overview

Bulk importing schemes is the **first and most critical step** for an EDP.  
Before adding or importing any vehicles, schemes must be created or uploaded in the system.

## Step-by-Step Process

The system validates the file and highlights any errors or duplicate entries.

- Number of **skipped rows**

This confirms whether the schemes were imported successfully.
